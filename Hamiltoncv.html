<P>Hamilton is without a doubt one of the most important aspects of my life.  I have been a huge fan of this revolutionary musical since the spring of 2016.  What makes this musical so incredible to me is how the stroy is told and written.  Hamilton is a rap musical written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.  The story follows the life and struggles of Alexander Hamilton, an orphan who immigrated to the United States, fought in the Revolutionary War, and ultimately became the nation's first Secretary of Treasury.  In the eyes of composer Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton's hardships throughout his life resembled those of modern day rap artists, and decided to tell Hamilton's story through the art of rap.</P>
