<P>In my last two years of high school, I was intensively involved in Drama Club.  My experiences in Drama Club were some of the best experiences of my life.  I made lifelong friendships, had the oppertunity to create captivating artwork, and won several state recognition awards for my work.  Here is a gallery of so,me of the shows in which I had the pleasure of partaking.</P>
